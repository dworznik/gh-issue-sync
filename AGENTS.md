# Development Rules

## First Message
If the user did not give you a concrete task in their first message, read README.md

## Commands
- NEVER commit unless user asks

## GitHub Issues
- We're dogfooding hard here, so always read them locally (unless you need comments)

go run ./cmd/gh-issue-sync pull
cat .issues/open/NUMBER-*.md

## Tools
- Use our own github issue sync (go run ./cmd/gh-issue-sync) for most operations
- GitHub CLI for issue comments/PRs
- TUI interaction: use tmux

## Style
- Keep answers short and concise
- No emojis in commits, issues, PR comments, or code
- No fluff or cheerful filler text
